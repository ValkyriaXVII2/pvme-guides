> __**Introduction**__
.tag:intro
⬥ The revolution combat mode allows the game to automatically activate abilities on your ability bar in a sequential order. There are three modes to revolution: only basics (revo), basics and thresholds (revo+), or basics and thresholds and ultimates (revo++).
      • For a player just getting into pvm or bossing it is perfectly fine to use revolution. 
      • There are helpful guides and ability bar set ups on the official RS Wiki that make revolution viable in combat. 
      • For most combat situations and scenarios, revolution is good enough.
⬥ Full manual is a combat mode where the game does not activate any abilities for you. Every ability you want to use in combat will require an input from the player. 
      • With no inputs from the player, full manual combat mode will only use auto attacks.
      • Full manual offers more control over what abilities are used, when they are used, and how they are used.

⬥ **__Channeled abilities__**
      • Usually last longer than a Global Cooldown (3 ticks or 1.8s).
      • Have an extra delay between the last hit of the ability and the start of the next ability.
          - This delay can be negated by manually inputting the next ability.
          - Revolution will let the delay run it's course which wastes time and damage.

⬥ Below is a comparison of manually canceling a channeled ability vs just letting revo do it for you. Top version will let revo cancel Snipe for them, with no manual input at all. The bottom version will manually cancel the Snipe ability to initiate the next ability quicker. Notice how long the top player just stands idle after the Snipe.
      • **Note:** manually canceling channeled abilities can be done on revolution mode. But, it still requires a manual input from the player with precise timing.

⬥ **__Ultimate abilities__**
      • Should normally be used manually even if using revo (except afk slayer).
      • Good revo bars will have the stronger abilities towards the beginning of the revo bar so they get activated more frequently.
          - This is good for general use but detrimental for damage boosting ultimates like Sunshine/Death's Swiftness/Berserk.
              • The best abilities will likely be on cooldown at the start of your damage boosting ult due to being at the front of the revo bar.
              • Some of the best abilities are bleeds which will be near the front of the revo bar, but bleeds are NOT boosted by damage boosting ultimates.
      • Full manual benefits a lot in damage boosting ultimates because you have full control of when you use the strong abilities.
          - Strong abilities can be saved until you are within the damage boosting ultimate to get more use out of them.
          - Bleed usage can be easily avoided in damage boosting ultimates since you can just choose to not input any bleed abilities.

⬥ The below gif will demonstrate how revo can make someone use bad abilities in a damage boosting ultimate (take a look at what abilities were used right after sunshine).

      • Using full manual, this person would have been able to plan out what abilities are used prior to activating Sunshine. They can choose to use bleeds such as Corruption Blast or Combust, or they can choose to use a weaker ability such as Tuska’s Wrath right before Sunshine to make sure the good abilities like Dragon Breath and Impact (Flanking) are off cooldown and ready to use in Sunshine.

⬥ **__Boss Mechanics__**
⬥ As you progress in pvm and face tougher and tougher bosses, you will encounter bosses with mechanics where revolution could greatly hinder your combat ability. Here are a few scenarios where revolution could cause more harm than good:
      • Arraxor: Web Shield mechanic 
          - Player must manually input to stop attacking, otherwise all damage gets reflected onto the player potentially causing a KO
      • Vorago: Reflect mechanic
          - Damage gets reflected onto a player and revo requires a manual input to stop attacking
      • Telos: Hold Still Invader
          - This mechanic is commonly dealt with by switching to a shield and using Resonance. This does require precise timings and if you are on revo, there is a chance that revo activates an ability while you are waiting to Resonance. This activates the Global Cooldown and you are unable to use Resonance in time.
      • Kalphite King: Beetlejuice (Green)
          - This mechanic requires provoking KK then either using Devotion or Resonance to negate/heal from the large hit. If using Resonance it requires precise timing.
      • Nex: Blood Siphon and Blood Phase
          - Any attacks during Blood Siphon will heal Nex rather than hurt her. This requires manual input to stop attacking during the special attack.
          - Blood phase has a mechanic where bleeds (Fragmentation Shot, Corruption Shot, etc.) will heal her instead of hurt her. Requires manual input to avoid using bleeds.
      • Helwyr: Swipe Attack
          - Strong melee attack. A common strategy to deal with the mechanic is to Resonance it to heal some health back. Requires precise timing and manual input.

> **More advanced scenarios:**
What if I use revolution but I manually activate basics most of the time? What benefit will full manual provide at that point?
This is a really good point and at this stage, there’s very minute things that full manual can offer to aid you in combat. Most of the examples below will relate to auto attacks. Revolution inherently does not interact smoothly with auto attacks unlike full manual.

> **High Input Revo vs. Full Manual**
__4 tick auto attack:__ 

Self explanatory. Undoubtably the biggest reason why many users prefer full manual over Revo (4taa is roughly a 7% dps increase when done well). Revo requires 2x input per every auto attack. One input to make your character stop attacking after gcd and a 2nd input to initiate the auto attack on the 4th tick. Auto attacks happen on every 7 ticks; do the math for a 5 minute boss encounter and that’s a lot of extra input you have to do if you’re attempting to 4taa on Revo. 

__Auto weaving in defensives:__

When using an ability that does not do damage, sometimes an auto attack will occur during gcd and provide an extra source of damage. Abilities such as Sunshine, Death Swiftness, Berzerk, Resonance, Anticipate, Freedom, Preperation, Reflect, Revenge, Provoke on gcd, Natural Instinct, Eldrich Special Attack (any ability that incurs a gcd but does not deal damage) are all examples of where this happens. Sometimes these auto attacks are purposely used to a) gain extra damage, and b) gain extra adrenaline. Using revolution, it is much more difficult to weave in an auto attack during gcd as inputting an auto-spell will halt any ability casting. Revo users will have to manually input an ability after the auto-spell to start revo again. Full manual users would just need to input an auto-spell during gcd and continue on in their rotation normally. 

__5 tick auto attack__

Similar to 4taa, 5 tick auto attack is used in Melee and Range rotations in substitution of an 100% damaging ability. An auto attack in Melee and Range deal an average of 130% ability damage, thus is better than a slice or a piercing shot basic ability. In dps-reliant phases, a 5taa can be used instead of a weaker basic ability as the 5taa is more damage. Revo users cannot do 5taa as there is no auto attack button for melee/range.

> **Positioning:**
On Revo, clicking underneath your character will not stop you deactivating revo. On full manual, clicking underneath your character will stop you from attacking (will stop auto attacks too). While it may seem small, staying on a particular square is important in certain boss mechanics. Examples include but not limited to: 
-    Vorago p5, dpsers must stay on the South wall
-    Vorago base, must keep Vorago in base spot for convenience
-    Vorago green bomb in 5 man teams, must form a square between 3 other players and stay in formation
-    Aod base, must keep her in the center of the arena for chinner and minions on p2 and p3.

**Final thoughts**: This is just a reminder that Full Manual is not needed to be proficient at pvm or bossing at all. You can do raids, Telos, duo Vorago, duo Solak, 7man Aod, etc using Revo and many players already do. However, if you’re looking to up your combat capabilities and squeeze in some more dps, full manual offers a range of benefits listed above that revo just cannot replicate.
